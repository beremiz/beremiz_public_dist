This toolchain contains cross compiler for raspberry pi image for beremiz runtime.

Due to big size, I have provided here google drive download link of the toolchain file.

After downloading this, User has to install this file and give a path for installation.

After successfull installation, User can find the sysroot directory in installation path and use it to build the compatible IDE for raspberry pi.
